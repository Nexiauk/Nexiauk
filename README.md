## Hi there 👋
My name is Lucy and I'm a junior software developer.
I learnt all about bootstrap before I knew what HTML was! I tend to drop myself into things at the deep end and figure it out from there - always a problem solver!

I dropped out of college at 17 and didn't return to education until my mid-30's. Despite absolutely smashing Turbo Pascal at college, it took me all this time to figure out that what I would like to do is wrangle code into submission.

So, here's some bullet points about me, using the pre-prepared template.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: becoming a software engineer
- 📫 How to reach me: nexiauk@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've walked on a live volcano!
