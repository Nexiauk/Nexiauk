## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Lucy and I'm a budding software developer.
I learnt all about bootstrap before I learnt what HTML was! I tend to drop myself into things at the deep end and figure it out from there - always a problem solver!

I dropped out of college at 17 and didn't return to education until my mid-30's. Despite absolutely smashing Turbo Pascal at college, it took me all this time to figure out that what I would like to do is wrangle code into submission.
My ideal job would be a game developer - maybe even an indie developer, start up my own little company one day. I know it's cut-throat out there, but hey, a woman can dream, right?

So, here's some bullet points about me, using the pre-prepared template.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: learning all about Javascript
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: that Javascript is a finicky beast who prefers to remain mysterious in many ways
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: savageflames@hotmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've walked on a live volcano!
